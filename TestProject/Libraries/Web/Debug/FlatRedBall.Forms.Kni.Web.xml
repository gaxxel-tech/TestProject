        <member name="M:FlatRedBall.Forms.Controls.Games.PlayerJoinView.SubscribeToGamepadEvents">
            <summary>
            Begins behavior to automatically detect gamepad connect and disconnect events. Also enables
            join and unjoin logic. This is automatically when the Visual is assigned, which is the default behavior when added
            through the FlatRedBall Editor.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            For convenience, SubscribeToGamepadEvents is called automatically when the visual is assigned. UnsubscribeFromGamepadEvents must 
            be called, but this happens automatically when the control is removed through the visual's RemoveFromManagers being called. This 
            method does not need to be called directly, but can happen as a result of its parent element being removed. Typically this is the
            Gum screen which is automatically removed when the FlatRedBall Screen is destroyed.
            
            Note that if the PlayerJoinView is constructed with a visual, but is never added to managers, then it will not unsubscribe
            from events. While minor, this does accumulate an event on InputManager.ControllerConnectionEvent.

            Examples of when to use ValueChangeCompleted would be to play an audio cue when changing

            <summary>
            Contains the default association between Forms Controls and Gum Runtime Types. 
            This dictionary enabled forms controls (like TextBox) to automatically create their own visuals.
            The key in the dictionary is the type of Forms control.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This dictionary simplifies working with FlatRedBall.Forms in code. It allows one piece of code 
            (which may be generated by Glue) to associate the Forms controls with a Gum runtime type. Once 
            this association is made, controls can be created without specifying a gum runtime. For example:
            var button = new Button();
            button.Visual.AddToManagers();
            button.Click += HandleButtonClick;
            
            Note that this association is used when instantiating a new Forms type in code, but it is not used when instantiating
            a new Gum runtime type - the Gum runtime must instantiate and associate its Forms object in its own code.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            FrameworkElement.DefaultFormsComponents[typeof(FlatRedBall.Forms.Controls.Button)] = 
                typeof(ProjectName.GumRuntimes.LargeMenuButtonRuntime);

            This may contain standard Gum types such as Gum.Forms.Controls, as well as derived types, such as

            Typically the Items is assigned or bound to an ObservableCollection. In this case

            The Items list is not guaranteed to reflect the items contained in the ItemsControl
            if Visual elements have been added directly to the InnerPanel. This can happen if the
            Visual's InnerPanel's Children are directly added to, or if an instance of an ItemsControl,
            such as a ListBox, is loaded from the Gum tool pre-filled with ListBoxItems. 
            
            If items are not added directly to the InnerPanel, then the Items list and the internal InnerPanel
            Children will remain in sync since the ItemsControl automatically creates FrameworkElement instances
            in response to the Items.
